# image-analysis

The image-analysis repository has scripts used for various analyses done on brightfield microscopy images, 
AFM images and outputs from analyses (e.g. coordinates of pore locations). 

Generally, they all involve identifying and counting things, or analysing distributions of things. 

Each code has a little description in the comments section.
